# Circle-Dodger
 
This is a fun little top-down shooter I created a while ago that I've been updating every so often.

You move around using the WASD keys and have to shoot enemies before they hit you. However, there is an added challenge: you can't just move anywhere because you are constantly running out of oxygen and need to keep picking up oxygen tanks which randomly spawn.

There is an online version at https://toggysmith.github.io/Games/CircleDodger2.1/CircleDodger.html.
